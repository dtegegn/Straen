# Straen
Straen is an open source workout tracker. It was initially written as a bike computer, but it also supports numerous other activities. This includes strength exercises, such as pull-ups and push-ups, as well as aerobic sports like running.

I wrote it because I was not satisfied with any of the closed-source workout trackers that were available. The phone is also an obvious replacement for expensive bike computers such as those made by Garmin.
