# Exert
Exert is an open source workout tracker. It was initially written as a bike computer, but it also supports numerous other activities. This includes strength exercises, such as pull-ups and push-ups, as well as aerobic sports like running. Exert is designed with the belief that the data generated while using it belongs to the end user and should never be locked behind a proprietary API. You can use Exert without being tracked, without needing to sign up for any services, and without being presented with any form of advertising. I started developing this application for my own use because I was not satisfied with any of the closed-source trackers currently on the market.

### Revision History
 - Currently in Beta

### Features
 - Support for distance-based activities such as running and cycling
 - Support for strength-based activities such as pull-ups and push-ups (or press-ups, depending on where you're from)
 - Support for Bluetooth sensors, including heart rate, bicycle cadence, wheel speed, and bicycle power
 - The ability to broadcast your location so your friends can follow you on your run or bike ride (off by default, of course)

### Development
Want to contribute? That's awesome! Exert is written in a combination of Objective-C and C++ and targets the Apple iPhone. Known issues are listed on the project's <a href="https://github.com/msimms/Exert/issues">GitHub Issues</a> page.

### Tech
Exert requires one other source project to work properly:

* [core-plot] - A graph plotting framework for iOS
